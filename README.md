## My process

Basically, this is my first time doing a project with JS and to be honest it was difficult, but not impossible. 
I have to give credit to many people especialy to guy from Youtube!


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I have seen JS exercises before, but this was the first that I tried to implement completely with functions, addEventListeners. Now I have more notion of how JS works as a whole
